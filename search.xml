Nevertheless, the process proved manageable. </p><p>The key elements were having a clean IP address and opting for manual verification by sending an email to explain my learning objective. After waiting for a reply and following the provided instructions, the entire application went smoothly and took less than a day to complete.</p>]]></content>
